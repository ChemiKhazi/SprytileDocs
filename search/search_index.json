Tile Palette The tile palette appears in the viewport when Sprytile tools are in use. This lets you select the tiles Sprytile will build or paint into Blender. Hold shift + Middle Mouse drag to move the palette around the viewport. Scroll Wheel zooms the tile palette. Ctrl + Scroll Wheel switches between tile grids. Main Panel This panel contains the main controls for Sprytile's tools. When you're using the tool modes or adjusting tile grids, this is the panel you'll most likely be interacting with. Build Tool Settings Build Tool Options The icons and options in the build tool carry over to the other Sprytile tool modes. Refer to this section if the icon you're looking for isn't covered in the other tool settings. Flip X/Flip Y \u2014 Flip tile orientation for placement Grid Rotation \u2014 Rotate tiles for placement Axis Indicator \u2014 The X/Y/Z buttons light up according to the Work Plane axis. Pressing the X/Y/Z buttons will lock the work plane to that axis. Axis Lock Toggle \u2014 Lock/unlock the work plane to the current axis Auto-join \u2014 Placing tiles will automatically join vertices Join Multi \u2014 When building with multiple tiles selected, joins them to a single face Allow Backface \u2014 Sprytile will work with backfaces when toggled on Paint Tool Settings Paint Tool Options The paint tool options allow you to control how Sprytile will fit the tile selection onto the painted faces. Option Description Pixel Snap UV vertices are snapped to the pixel grid Stretch X/Y Force painted faces to fit into the tile selection Snap To Edge If a UV vertex is close to the edge of the tile selection, snap it to the edge Threshold how much the UV vertex needs to be close to the edge UV Align Controls alignment of painted face to the tile selection. Most relevant when stretch options are turned off. Hinting Selected edges will be used to indicate to Sprytile which part of the painted face is considered down Fill Tool Settings Fill Tool Options Fill Size - Size of fill grid Lock Transforms - Keep the rotations of filled tiles Grid Settings This is where you can create additional tile grids, or add new tilesets Special Grid Types 1x1 Tile Grids Creating a 1x1 tile grid allows the most flexibility when using Sprytile, allowing you to freely select any part of your texture for use with Sprytile's tools. Grid Settings Details Tile grids can be named in the left part of the grid selection list, to help with organizing grids. Pressing the + button will duplicate the currently selected grid, and the size can then be adjusted using the Grid Size input. The - button will delete the selected grid. Additional tilesets can be loaded using the dropdown menu. If the grid list starts bugging out, please use the Validate Tile Grids tool. Extra Grid Settings Selecting a grid and expanding Extra UV Grid Settings gives access to additional settings to tweak. Tile Bleed Bleeding is when textures spill outside tiles or create seams in real time engines. To address bleed, you can use the Auto Pad or Padding settings. Auto Pad will move the UV edges inward by a subpixel amount, set by Pad Offset . Padding will add extra pixels to the top and sides of tiles, to allow you to manually paint in the bleed safe space. Offset Offset changes the origin of the tile grid in the tileset texture. This allows for grids of different sizes to be used in one texture without having to find a common denominator to make the grids fit. The origin of the offset is from the lower left corner of the texture. Margins Some tilesets may leave pixel gaps between tiles. You can try adjusting the padding and margin values to work with those tileset. Workflow Panel Workflow Details Cursor Flow Turning on Cursor Flow will automatically move the cursor to the last tile you placed, which can be useful for larger projects. UV Correction Toggle Blender 2.9 introduced UV correction, which automatically preserves UVs as you move mesh elements around. When combined with increment snapping, this gives pixel perfect UV editing in the viewport. When Sprytile is installed in 2.9, this toggle is available to quickly turn it on and off. Image Reload Pressing the Reload All Images will reload all images that are used by your scene, allowing you to quickly refresh textures after editing them in an external program. Toggling on Auto will automatically refresh the textures every second. Sprytile Utilities This menu contains some helpful tools for Sprytile's workflow. This is available in Sprytile's panel under Object and Edit mode. Utility Details Reset Sprytile - If Sprytile breaks, it might be necessary to use this. Floor Grid To Pixels - Set Blender's grid subdivision to the world pixel density, useful for making Blender's incremental snap to one pixel.

This also applies to Blender version 2.8. This is not meant to teach beginners Blender basics, but will try to be as accomodating as possible. We'll be using the following tile set image for this tutorial, but feel free to use your own tileset to follow along. tileset.png Click to download Installation Download the zip file from the itch.io page . Sprytile can be downloaded for free, but donations are very much appreciated. 1. Install Addon In Blender, open User Preferences by going to Edit > Preferences . Go to the Add-ons tab and press the Install button and navigate to the downloaded zip file. 2. Enable Addon After installation, make sure you enable the addon by checking the box on the top left. Addon Preferences There are preferences in the addon tab that you may want to change, according to your own workflow. You can always come back to these preferences when you figure out what works for you. Starting Sprytile With Sprytile installed and setup, let's start a new Blender file by going to File > New > General . In Blender 2.9, Sprytile shows up in the Toolbar to the left of the viewport, and in the Sidebar to the right . If you don't see the toolbar on the left press T to show the tools , and if there are no panels on the right press N to show the sidebar . You can also toggle them through the View menu. If the Sprytile properties panel is not available in the right sidebar, make sure Sprytile is enabled in Blender's add-ons preferences. Sprytile Setup Before using Sprytile tools, there are a couple of things to setup. Loading Tilesets Sprytile needs to know the textures it is working with. Go to the Sprytile panel in the right sidebar and press Load Tileset . Choose the tileset texture and the material and texture are automatically setup. If you are using more than one tileset, use the Add Tileset button to make additional materials. Viewport Setup The default Blender viewport settings can make your textures look duller than intended. If you won't do any advanced rendering in your scene, you may want to use Setup Pixel Viewport in the Sprytile Utilities dropdown. There is an option in the Sprytile addon preferences to always use this setting. Most of Sprytile's tools are accessed under Edit Mode of a mesh object . Select the default Blender cube, and enter edit mode by pressing the Tab key. Build Tool The build tool creates faces that are UV mapped to the selected tiles. Open Sprytile's tile map mode by pressing the Sprytile Build tool. The tile palette will appear on the lower left corner of the viewport, indicating that Sprytile is active. If the palette is hidden by the toolbar, move the tile palette by putting your mouse in the tile palette, holding the shift key , and middle mouse dragging the tile palette. The scroll wheel zooms the palette in and out . Exit the build tool by going into any of Blender's other tools. Pressing the W key will take you to Blender's select tool. First, delete the existing vertices of the cube so we have a blank slate. Do this by pressing A to select all, and then pressing X and selecting Vertices . Sprytile's workflow revolves around Blender's 3D cursor and the direction the 3D view is facing. The 3D cursor is the center of the tile grid when you're painting, and the global axis that the view is facing is the surface you will be painting on. Let's start by reseting the 3D cursor to the center of the scene by pressing Shift + S and selecting Cursor to World Origin . While in the build tool, try rotating the 3D view camera around. Hold down the middle mouse button while the mouse cursor is in the 3D view and move the mouse. Notice that a grid appears around the blender 3D cursor. This is called the work plane and indicates the plane that you'll be placing tiles onto. By default, the work plane appears when the view camera is panned. If it does not show up, check the settings . Tilt the camera downwards so that the work plane is aligned to the ground. In the tile palette, choose the grass tile and paint around the 3D cursor. The grid is centered around the 3D cursor and the painted tiles appear on the ground, as shown by the work plane. Now pan the camera up so the work plane is vertical. Pick a wall tile and paint with the tile. Since the 3D cursor is an important part of the Sprytile workflow, you can move the 3D cursor to the vertex nearest the mouse cursor by holding down the S key while using Sprytile's tools. Try facing the 3D view to the last axis you have yet to build on, then moving the 3D cursor by holding down the S key and moving your mouse. Paint on that axis. Note that the center of the grid has moved to where you have positioned the cursor. Tile Grids With the basics of building done, let's look at tile grids. Tilesets might be made up of tiles in different sizes. Sprytile uses the concepts of tile grids to allow for this. This part of the Sprytile panel allows you to create and organize the grid settings used with the tile map. Press the + button at the panel and select the newly created entry. The settings for this new tile grid can be changed in the boxes below. For the new grid, lets change it to a 16 x 16 tile size. Fill Tool Looking closely at the last wall we created, the texture repetition is obvious. We'll use the smaller 16x16 tile grid we just made to break up the pattern. Exit the build tool if you haven't done so yet, and delete the faces of wall we just created. For Blender Newbies To delete faces in Blender, go into the tweak/select tool by pressing W . Go into face mode by pressing the 3 key. Select the faces to be deleted. Delete them by pressing either X or Del , and then choosing faces in the menu that appears. Bonus tip: holding shift adds or removes to your selection. Holding ctrl will select the shortest path from your last selection to the new selection. Blender has powerful selection options worth exploring yourself. To recreate the wall, we'll use the Sprytile fill tool. Select the fill tool from the toolbar, making sure the 16x16 grid is selected. The work plane has become bigger, showing the area the tool will fill. The default fill size is a bit large, let's adjust it in the options to a more reasonable 6x4 grid. This part of the Sprytile panel is where the settings for Sprytile tools can be adjusted. As with other Sprytile tools, the fill tool is centered around Blender's 3D cursor. Holding the S key will snap the cursor to vertex nearest to the mouse, but there are no verts where we want to move the fill tool to. We can instead use the grid snap mode in the workflow panel. Set cursor snap to grid, and then hold down the S key to move the work plane with your mouse. Position the fill plane to where you want to build the wall, select the wall in the tile palette, and click inside the fill plane. Tile Flipping/Rotation To address the obvious tiling on the wall we can go back to the build tool and paint over the wall, but this time using tile rotations and flipping to break up the pattern. The highlighted part of the Sprytile panel will rotate or flip tiles when you paint. You can use the keyboard shortcuts Q / E to rotate the tiles to the left or right. Shift + Q / E will flip the tiles vertically or horizontally. Repaint the wall using the tile flipping and rotation options. Tile Picker You can pick tiles from your scene like in Photoshop. Hold down the Alt key and select a tile from the scene with a left mouse click. Paint Mode Finally, we'll cover paint mode. Paint mode gives you tools to quickly UV map faces to tiles, allowing you to build your mesh with other Blender tools. Let's extrude the edges of the grass without using tile map mode so that the geometry isn't on the pixel grid anymore. Next, use the Sprytile Paint tool and with the 32x32 tile grid, select the tile that is the border of the grass and the ground and paint onto the new edge we created. The texture appears stretched because of the current paint settings. We can correct this by using these settings in the Sprytile tool panel. These options only appear for Paint mode. Paint mode is dependent on the angle of your viewport. Try to rotate the camera so you're facing the front of the face you're painting on. Advanced Painting Paint mode allows for easy UV mapping even when the face is not aligned to the global XYZ axis. Create a low poly cylinder and rotate it so it is not aligned to the global XYZ axis. For Blender Newbies Pressing Shift+A will bring up the add object menu. Choose cylinder, and set sensible settings for the cylinder. Move objects by pressing G and moving your mouse, and pressing R will rotate objects. Switch to the 16x16 tile grid and select orange metallic tile. Try to paint the sides of the cylinder. It may be difficult to be consistent because of the rotation of the cylinder. Switch to edge selection mode and select one of the cylinder's edges along the long side. In Sprytile's setting panel, turn on hinting and then try painting the cylinder again. For Blender Newbies Inside the mesh edit mode, you can switch between 3 different subobject selection modes: Vertex, Edge, and Face. These are the components of a mesh. You can switch between them in this part of the viewport, or by pressing the 1 (Vertex), 2 (Edge), or 3 (Face) keys. Paint on the sides of the cylinder again, and now the paint direction is consistent. Hinting tells Sprytile which side of the painted face should be considered the bottom side of the tile. Conclusion This tutorial gives an overview of Sprytile's basic functions, hopefully enough to help you to start building cool things with it.

For Blender Newbies To delete faces in Blender, go into the tweak/select tool by pressing W . Go into face mode by pressing the 3 key. Select the faces to be deleted. Delete them by pressing either X or Del , and then choosing faces in the menu that appears. Bonus tip: holding shift adds or removes to your selection. Holding ctrl will select the shortest path from your last selection to the new selection. Blender has powerful selection options worth exploring yourself. To recreate the wall, we'll use the Sprytile fill tool. Select the fill tool from the toolbar, making sure the 16x16 grid is selected. The work plane has become bigger, showing the area the tool will fill. The default fill size is a bit large, let's adjust it in the options to a more reasonable 6x4 grid. This part of the Sprytile panel is where the settings for Sprytile tools can be adjusted. As with other Sprytile tools, the fill tool is centered around Blender's 3D cursor. Holding the S key will snap the cursor to vertex nearest to the mouse, but there are no verts where we want to move the fill tool to. We can instead use the grid snap mode in the workflow panel. Set cursor snap to grid, and then hold down the S key to move the work plane with your mouse. Position the fill plane to where you want to build the wall, select the wall in the tile palette, and click inside the fill plane.","title":"Fill Tool"},{"location":"quick-start/#tile-flippingrotation","text":"To address the obvious tiling on the wall we can go back to the build tool and paint over the wall, but this time using tile rotations and flipping to break up the pattern. The highlighted part of the Sprytile panel will rotate or flip tiles when you paint. You can use the keyboard shortcuts Q / E to rotate the tiles to the left or right. Shift + Q / E will flip the tiles vertically or horizontally. Repaint the wall using the tile flipping and rotation options. Tile Picker You can pick tiles from your scene like in Photoshop. Hold down the Alt key and select a tile from the scene with a left mouse click.","title":"Tile Flipping/Rotation"},{"location":"quick-start/#paint-mode","text":"Finally, we'll cover paint mode. Paint mode gives you tools to quickly UV map faces to tiles, allowing you to build your mesh with other Blender tools. Let's extrude the edges of the grass without using tile map mode so that the geometry isn't on the pixel grid anymore. Next, use the Sprytile Paint tool and with the 32x32 tile grid, select the tile that is the border of the grass and the ground and paint onto the new edge we created. The texture appears stretched because of the current paint settings. We can correct this by using these settings in the Sprytile tool panel. These options only appear for Paint mode. Paint mode is dependent on the angle of your viewport. Try to rotate the camera so you're facing the front of the face you're painting on.","title":"Paint Mode"},{"location":"quick-start/#advanced-painting","text":"Paint mode allows for easy UV mapping even when the face is not aligned to the global XYZ axis. Create a low poly cylinder and rotate it so it is not aligned to the global XYZ axis. For Blender Newbies Pressing Shift+A will bring up the add object menu. Choose cylinder, and set sensible settings for the cylinder. Move objects by pressing G and moving your mouse, and pressing R will rotate objects. Switch to the 16x16 tile grid and select orange metallic tile. Try to paint the sides of the cylinder. It may be difficult to be consistent because of the rotation of the cylinder. Switch to edge selection mode and select one of the cylinder's edges along the long side. In Sprytile's setting panel, turn on hinting and then try painting the cylinder again. For Blender Newbies Inside the mesh edit mode, you can switch between 3 different subobject selection modes: Vertex, Edge, and Face. These are the components of a mesh. You can switch between them in this part of the viewport, or by pressing the 1 (Vertex), 2 (Edge), or 3 (Face) keys. Paint on the sides of the cylinder again, and now the paint direction is consistent. Hinting tells Sprytile which side of the painted face should be considered the bottom side of the tile.","title":"Advanced Painting"},{"location":"quick-start/#conclusion","text":"This tutorial gives an overview of Sprytile's basic functions, hopefully enough to help you to start building cool things with it.

There is a collection of models made with Sprytile that I curate on Sketchfab. These are settings I've found to be a good base for making your low poly pixel art texture models look good in Sketchfab . Think of this as a base, there are additional ways to make presenting your models more eye catching in Sketchfab! Power of Two Textures If you've read the previous guides, you may know by now how important it is to have power of two sized textures for your 3D models, and it is especially important with Sketchfab. The technology used by Sketchfab to display models is sensitive to sizes and non power of two textures will have artifacts no matter how closely you follow the rest of this guide. There are workarounds to this limitation if necessary, but it will always result in some artifacts. Upload to Sketchfab Sketchfab will accept Blender files as uploads from their web interface. Sketchfab 3D Settings Once you've exported your model from Blender to Sketchfab, go to the sketchfab website in your browser and edit the 3D settings for your model. First, set the renderer type to PBR , and shading to Shadeless . Next, go to the Materials tab, and in the PBR Maps settings expand the Base Color dropdown to get to texture settings. Set filtering to Nearest , format to RGB , and both wrap settings to Repeat Next, scroll down to the Opacity settings and turn it on. Set it to Mask and turn the slider up to 1. Expand the textures again and make sure the filter, format, and wrap settings are correct. These settings provide a good base for the low poly pixel art style of 3D. You can experiment with the how you present your models by playing with the post processing effects on Sketchfab , or even trying out animations. Non Power of Two Workaround If your texture cannot be power of two, one thing you can do is to scale up the texture by 2x, 3x, or 4x in an image editor. This will result in a larger texture, but may hide some of the artifacts caused by smaller non power of two sized textures.","title":"Sketchfab Export"},{"location":"sketchfab/#exporting-for-sketchfab","text":"Sketchfab is an online service that allows you to showcase your 3D work inside a browser.

These settings should be considered starting points for your projects, you should experiment with these to make your game visuals unique. Retro/Pixel Art When using low res pixelart tilesets we'll can use the settings below for textures, materials and rendering to achieve that old school look. Texture Textures should be set to the following settings: Generate Mip Maps: Off Filter Mode: Point (no filter) Material When importing a .blend file into Unity, a material asset will be created for each material in the Blender scene. Materials decide how your mesh will be rendered. The simplest Unity material to use is the Unlit Transparent texture, which will render your models similar to how you see it in Blender. However, this material cannot be affected by lights. If you'd like to use lighting in your scenes, you can use the Standard shader set to the cutout rendering mode. This material can be a bit more complex to work with, but can be lit in interesting ways. Camera and Anti Aliasing Settings You may notice seams appearing in the textures of your models in Unity. The easiest way to fix this is to turn off anti-aliasing in the camera or quality settings of your project. To disable anti-aliasing in the camera, select your camera object and turn off Allow MSAA. To turn off anti-aliasing in the project level, open the project quality settings by going to Edit > Project Settings > Quality .

Power of Two Texture Sizes The importance of Power of Two texture sizes is discussed in detail in creating tilesets . If you wish to use your scenes in a game engine, you will likely need to resize the tileset you want to use so that it is a power of two size. The easiest way to do this is to expand the canvas size so that it becomes a power of two size. The downside is that this is a wasteful use of texture space in 3D engines. The recommended method that takes more work is to remove tiles from the tileset that will not be used, or to split the tileset into multiple textures that are power of two sized. UI considerations Related to the texture sizes, the Sprytile UI was not designed with existing tile sets in mind.
