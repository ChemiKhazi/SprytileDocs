# Blender Basics

If you're new to Blender, this section of the tutorial will teach enough Blender basics to confidently use Sprytile.

Blender is an [opensource 3D software package](https://www.blender.org/) that is free to use. It is incredibly versatile and can handle many 3D tasks but for the purpose of Sprytile, we'll be using it for its 3D modeling capabilities.

Start by [getting the latest recommended version](https://www.blender.org/download/) of Blender from the download page and installing it, do not get the Release Candidate.

Start Blender after installation and you will see the following screen. The splash screen artwork may be different depending on the version you installed.

## Window Areas

Click outside the splash box and you should see this. This is the default layout of the Blender window. The labeled parts are what we'll be using while working with Sprytile.

The window areas can be resized to better fit your needs by moving the mouse between areas and dragging when indicated. 

### 3D View

The window used to interact with the 3D scene we're working with. This where we'll be spending most of our time working in Blender.

### Tool Shelf

Technically part of the 3D view, the tool shelf is a convenient place for Blender's various tools. It is also where we'll interact with Sprytile's tools when Sprytile is installed.

If the tool shelf disappears while you're working with Blender, press the `T` key while your mouse is in 3D view to show it again.

### Properties View

The properties panel is used for setting the data for Blender's various components. For Sprytile, we'll only be concerned with the Material and Texture tabs.

### Outliner

## Camera Navigation

Now we'll learn how to move around in the 3D view. This is important to learn as this is how we'll move around while editing the scene.

!!! note "No Middle Mouse Button?"

	If you do not have a middle mouse button, follow the [instructions in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqEYfSb6t8) to enable three button mouse emulation, and add holding down the `Alt` key to the following instructions.

When you want to move around in 3D view, your mouse cursor must start from inside the 3D view. Releasing the middle mouse button will stop moving the 3D view.

### Rotation/Panning

Hold down the middle mouse button and move the mouse around.

Notice that the camera rotates around a focus point.

### Horizontal/Vertical Movement

Press and hold down the `Shift` key and then hold down the middle mouse button.

Moving the mouse will now move the camera along horizontal and vertical axis that the camera is facing.

### Forward/Backward Movement

This time, press and hold down the `Ctrl` key before holding down middle mouse.

Moving the mouse now moves the camera forwards and backwards from the direction the camera is facing.

Practice these camera moves until you're comfortable moving around the 3D view.
