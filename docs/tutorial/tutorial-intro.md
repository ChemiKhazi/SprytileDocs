# Tutorial Introduction

This tutorial will help you learn how to use Sprytile along with Blender.

Sprytile is an addon for Blender that helps you build 3D scenes using 2D tilesets, in a fun and intuitive way.

If you are new to Blender or 3D modeling, this tutorial will try to teach you 3D concepts relevant to using Sprytile, but is not a comprehensive guide.

Users already familiar with Blender may wish to skip the first chapter and go straight into the [installation instructions](install.md).
