# Installing Spyrtile

Sprytile is compatible with **Blender 2.77 and higher**. Make sure you have a compatible version of Blender installed. You may [install multiple versions of Blender](https://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?353193-Installing-multiple-version-of-blender) on your computer by using the .zip versions if needed.

After installing a compatible version of Blender, [download the addon zip file](http://itch.sprytile.xyz) from the Sprytile page.

## Installation

In Blender, open User Preferences by going to `File > User Preferences`. Go to the Add-ons tab and press  `Install from File` at the bottom of the preference window and navigate to the downloaded zip file.

## Settings Changes

We now need to make some changes to the Blender settings after installing Sprytile.

First, under the add-ons tab, search for Sprytile under Community addons and enable it.

To make sure Blender shows pixel art textures correctly, we have to turn off mipmaps in 3D view. In the preferences window, switch over to the `System` tab and turn off the Mipmaps option under OpenGL.

!!! note

	If you are not using Sprytile for pixel art style textures, you may skip this step. If you will be using Blender for non pixel art textured purposes in the future, remember to turn Mipmaps back on in the settings.

We're now done with installing Sprytile and changing the settings to be optimal for pixel art style textures.

## Save User Settings

Before closing the preferences window, make sure to press the `Save User Settings` button on the bottom left corner to make sure that our new settings are saved for the next time Blender is opened.
